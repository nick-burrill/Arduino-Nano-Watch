This is my Arduino Nano based Watch firmware. The watch is currently planned to be a "dumb" watch with a few extra features.

Here are some planned specs:
-Real time clock
-Stopwatch
-Timer
-Alarm
-Counter

Some system level goodies:
-System wide drawing functions for basic UI elements like titles, time input, and time display
-Multibutton input
